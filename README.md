This is a summation of what was discovered while exploring building in the Koii ecosystem

We spent time trying to decide the true value of utilizing the Koii network and boiled it down to a few key items including (but not limited to:)
    -User presence on IPFS website is the data point tracked that needs to be explored for how much data is monitored during the instance. Is it timestamp, user identifier, location to start). Meta data needs to be fleshed out, but is potentially valuable depending on what is captured.
    InterPlanetary Filing System (IPFS) is an independent repository of data as opposed to being centralized and resold.
    Koii can position itself to become the Web2 to Web3 Bridge if the use cases for the data are very specific (customized trackable ads, community curation, etc.)
If you curate your community on Koii, as the creator, you can flesh out the utilization from data collected from all users that you bring to community





Pros and Cons


Pros to using Koii -

  Using Koii would enable portability of data.
  Decentralization of the collection of user/visitorâ€™s data
  Koii  is superior to Google Analytics for these reasons:
    Google can demonetize content depending on subject matter
    Google sells your data to competitor
    Koii can easily replace Google Analytics depending on the token created (signatures, timestamp, URL) 
    It is easy to learn to switch to using Koii vs Google because it doest change the current coding workflow when SEO Optimizing a site. Architecture of code is easy       to replace in a few lines of code (interoperable association). Low overhead to replace.
      If you want to mine data, with Koii, I can do whatever I want to do with data, like creating a dashboard. The customizability makes it more attractive to use.



Cons to Using Koii that we recommend be updated
  Your data is available to anyone if wallet data was reverse engineered and tracked.
      Possible solution/opportunity for growth - Offer possibility to encrypt the owners data at private key level
  Monetization strategy is currently a con
    Current model is unsustainable (giving money for attention has been tried with Brave, and they are able to offset cost burden due to ads, Koii does not currently       offer ads) Opportunity for growth is offering incentivized relevant ads.
  Other revenue options could be evaluating content collective. Can you do something with this content that you are curating and governing while incentivizing people       to put content on the Koii network? 
  If Koii has been bustin open for free, why would a pay model now be sustainable? Users will not pay for something that they have already been using for free at           liberty.
  Koii could improve by providing a more robust method of collecting metadata. Current con is aimless data collection.
      Fruitful examples of data collection inckude (Waze Participation points, Reddit Upvotes, Bing with fiat)
  You cant pay/reward people for doing things they are naturally supposed to be doing. This model has been proven to fail once incentiviztion stops.
Tokennomics issues potentially
-	Koii attempting to create scarcity by allowing larger stake holders to stake a portion of Koii tokens is not a secure method to creating scarcity.


Current barries to creating a solution for Koii
  No slide deck
  Koii doesn't have a clear use case. Community would have to be continuously incentivized to make the switch for adoption
  Curated geo tagged ads in search bar ad space because there is not a proper analytics platform with proprer data tracking
  Cant create the Port token inside of ad to capture details of people that interact with the ads because there currently is no data repository
